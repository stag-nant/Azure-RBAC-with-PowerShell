This guide provides step-by-step instructions on configuring Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using PowerShell. It covers:

✅ Assigning built-in roles (Network Contributor, Storage Account Contributor)

✅ Creating and managing Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)

✅ Troubleshooting role assignment failures

✅ Creating custom roles using Azure Cloud Shell and JSON

✅ Resolving "Forbidden" permission errors

Perfect for cloud administrators, security professionals, and DevOps engineers who need to manage access control in Azure environments efficiently.


📌 Includes PowerShell commands & examples for easy implementation!

## 🔹 **Why RBAC is Critical in Cloud Security**  

Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) ensures that users and applications have **only the necessary permissions** to perform their tasks. This follows the **principle of least privilege (PoLP)**, reducing the risk of **data breaches, unauthorized access, and security misconfigurations**.  

### 🔍 **Why This Matters**  

📌 **23% of cloud security incidents** result from **misconfigured access controls** *(Source: [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/cloud-security-statistics/#:~:text=by%20hackers%20online.-,Cloud%20Misconfigurations%20Statistics,concern%20for%20public%20cloud%20organizations))*
